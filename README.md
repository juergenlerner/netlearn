Network analysis and machine learning of relational data.

This is a loose collection of code related with **learn**ing and teaching methods for **net**work analysis and machine **learn**ing of relational data (**net**work data).  

This code is intended for educational purposes to *illustrate* how methods could be implemented. It is not intended to ever become something resembling a library. If ever there is a tradeoff between a simpler and more transparent implementation on one hand and a more robust, more efficient, but more complex implementation on the other hand, we typically choose the simpler one.

## Efficient data structures for sparse graphs

Illustration how to implement in java efficient data structures for sparse graphs which are asymptotically optimal in both space (memory) consumption and runtime complexity.

See [```src/kn/uni/nl/ds/graph/```](https://github.com/juergenlerner/netlearn/tree/main/src/kn/uni/nl/ds/graph) for code.
